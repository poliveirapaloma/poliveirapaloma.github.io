I have six years of experience with students environment and in this time I have worked as Marketing Consultant to Educational Institutions.

Last year I’d worked as Volunteer in Toronto, at ISX for 5 months. There I was working with Tours & day trips saleswoman and customer service, promoting in international schools and working in the marketing area supporting new projects and ideas to improve the customer’s experience. That time I learned more about life of a student in Toronto and how to deal with them. In addition to that, my experience with Project Management gave to me leadership experience, organization, planning skills, Microsoft Office and Google products advanced, excellent computer skills, Digital Marketing skills, and so on.
